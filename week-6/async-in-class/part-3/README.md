### Part 3 - Gotta Catch 'Em All!

1.  Figure out how to make a single request to the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to get names and URLs for every pokemon in the database.

2.  Once you have names and URLs of all the pokemon, pick three at random and make requests to their URLs. Once those requests are complete, console log the data for each pokemon.

3.  (BONUS) Build an HTML page that lets you click on a button to generate data from three randomly chosen pokemon. Include the name of the pokemon, an image of the pokemon, and a description of its species (you'll need to make another request for this data!) Here's how this could look:
