# Asynchronous Code in JavaScript

Let's have some fun working with AJAX!

Here are some exercises for you to work on in class. For all of them:

1.  Solve them using callbacks.
2.  Then, refactor them to use promises.
3.  Refactor them using `async` / `await`.

Check out README files in each of the directories (`part-1`, `part-2`, `part-3`) to get started!
