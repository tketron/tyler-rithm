### Part 1 - Number Facts

1.  Make a request to the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/) to get a fact about your favorite number. (Make sure you [get back JSON by including the `json` query key, specific to this API.](http://numbersapi.com/#json))

2.  Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.

3.  Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Once you have them all, put them on the page (you'll need to make multiple requests for this.)
